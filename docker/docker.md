# Teachable Notes
From the Teachable course, please prepare yourself to answer questions similar to these:

- Differences between virtualisation and containerisation
    VMs are fully simulated machines complete with OS and such. Containers are smaller units packaged with only the specific dependencies for that application.
- What is usually included in a container vs virtual machine?
- Pros/cons of using:
  - Traditional architecture.
        Simple, easy, but no flexibility
  - Virtualisation.
        Let's you run multiple systems on one machine, so more flexible than ^^. But each VM has to simulate an entire OS, so they're pretty resource heavy.
  - Containerisation.
        Lighter weight than VMs. Smaller and cross-platform, making them more flexible again.
  - Docker.
